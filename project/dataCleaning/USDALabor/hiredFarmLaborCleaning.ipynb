    "# USDA 2012 – 2017 Hired Labor Data\n",

    "## Data Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset includes state-level hired farm labor data in the United States for the years 2012 and 2017. It captures the number of hired workers, broken down by days worked, as well as totals for migrant and unpaid workers. The data offers insights into the structure and trends of the agricultural labor force across states. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structure \n",
    "    state (string): Name of the U.S. state \n",
    "    year (int): Reporting year \n",
    "    Hired farm labor (string): Total number of hired farm workers \n",
    "    Workers by days worked – 150 days or more: Number of workers employed for 150 days or more \n",
    "    Workers by days worked – Less than 150 days: Number of workers employed for less than 150 days \n",
    "    Reported only workers working 150 days or more: Workers reported only in the 150+ days category \n",
    "    Reported only workers working less than 150 days: Workers reported only in the <150 days category \n",
    "    Reported both - 150 days or more, workers: Workers who worked both categories, counted in 150+ days \n",
    "    Reported both - less than 150 days, workers: Workers who worked both categories, counted in <150 days \n",
    "    Total migrant workers: Number of migrant workers \n",
    "    Unpaid workers: Number of unpaid farm workers \n",
    "\n",
    "Values are generally stored as strings, some with formatting (e.g., commas), and may include codes like (D) indicating data is undisclosed or unavailable. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Collection & Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "The data was originally sourced from the USDA labor reports. It has been cleaned, structured consistently, and split by year for ease of analysis. Days worked serves as a primary categorization for labor type. Inclusion of migrant and unpaid worker counts allows for deeper exploration of farm labor conditions and workforce composition. "

These categories are not mutually exclusive with “Hired farm labor.” "
